# BlindSpot

BlindSpot is an advanced WiFi security auditing and penetration testing tool. It combines a powerful Python-based command-line interface (CLI) for Linux with custom firmware for ESP32 and NodeMCU8266 devices to perform sophisticated attacks, including Evil Twin, Deauthentication, and Handshake/PMKID capturing.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Discover available WiFi networks and clients.
- **Deauthentication Attacks**: Disconnect clients from target networks.
- **Handshake & PMKID Capture**: Capture WPA/WPA2 handshakes and PMKIDs for cracking.
- **Evil Twin Attack**: Create a fake access point to capture credentials (requires ESP32/NodeMCU).
- **Database Management**: Store and manage captured network information.
- **Hybrid Mode**: Works as a standalone tool using a WiFi adapter or pairs with an ESP32/NodeMCU for enhanced capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `BlindSpot3/`: The main Python application for Linux.
- `ESP32-DePortal2/`: Firmware for ESP32 devices.
- `NodeMCU8266-DePortal2/`: Firmware for NodeMCU (ESP8266) devices.

## 1. Firmware Installation (ESP32 / NodeMCU)

To use the advanced features like the Evil Twin attack, you need to flash the firmware onto your ESP32 or NodeMCU device.

### Prerequisites
- **VS Code**: [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **PlatformIO IDE**: An extension for VS Code.

### Steps to Install

1.  **Install PlatformIO**:
    - Open VS Code.
    - Go to the **Extensions** view (click the square icon on the left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
    - Search for `PlatformIO IDE`.
    - Click **Install**.

2.  **Open the Firmware Project**:
    - In VS Code, go to **File > Open Folder...**
    - Select the folder corresponding to your device:
        - For **ESP32**: Select the `ESP32-DePortal2` folder.
        - For **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**: Select the `NodeMCU8266-DePortal2` folder.

3.  **Connect Your Device**:
    - Connect your ESP32 or NodeMCU board to your computer via a USB cable.

4.  **Upload Firmware**:
    - Wait for PlatformIO to initialize (you'll see a loading indicator in the bottom status bar).
    - Once ready, click the **Upload** button (the right-pointing arrow icon `→`) in the bottom blue status bar of VS Code.
    - Alternatively, you can open the **PlatformIO** sidebar (alien icon), go to **Project Tasks**, and click **Upload**.

5.  **Verify**:
    - PlatformIO will compile the code and upload it to your board.
    - Once finished, you will see a "SUCCESS" message in the terminal.

## 2. Python App Usage (Linux)

The Python application runs on Linux and acts as the control center. It requires a WiFi adapter that supports **Monitor Mode**.

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Linux (Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or Ubuntu recommended).
- **Python 3**: Installed by default on most Linux distros.
- **Dependencies**:
    - `scapy`
    - `aircrack-ng` (for system tools like `iwconfig`, `airmon-ng`)

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install scapy
    ```

### How to Run

Navigate to the application directory:
```bash
cd BlindSpot3
```

#### Mode 1: Standalone (No ESP32)
Use this mode if you only want to use your WiFi adapter for scanning and deauth attacks.

```bash
sudo python3 main.py <interface_name>
# Example:
sudo python3 main.py wlan0
```

#### Mode 2: Hybrid (With ESP32/NodeMCU)
Use this mode to enable Evil Twin attacks and offload some tasks to the external device.

1.  Connect your flashed ESP32/NodeMCU to the USB port.
2.  Find the serial port (usually `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).
3.  Run the tool with the port argument:

```bash
sudo python3 main.py <interface_name> <serial_port>
# Example:
sudo python3 main.py wlan0 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Menu Options
- **1. Scan**: Start scanning for networks.
- **2. Client Monitor**: Monitor clients connected to a specific network.
- **3. Mass Attack**: Deauth attack on multiple targets.
- **4. Database**: View captured handshakes and networks.
- **6. Evil Twin**: (In Target Menu) Start the Evil Twin attack using the ESP32.
